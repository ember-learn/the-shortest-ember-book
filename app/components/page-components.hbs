            Components are reusable pieces of JavaScript code and markup
            that form the user interface. Here are some examples of
            features that a developer might create a component for:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="button.png" class="img-half-width img-button">
        </p>
        <p>
            Components in Ember render lighting-fast as data in your
            app changes. There are straightforward ways to organize
            components and connect them together, so that they can
            be independently changed and rearranged when project
            requirements shift.
