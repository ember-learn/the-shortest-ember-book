            A maintainable app needs tests, so Ember makes testing as easy as possible.

                    `ember test` builds the app and runs tests in the browsers of your choice.
                    For example, you can watch the tests running right in the
                    browser and pause them to inspect the DOM. You could also
                    run them in headless browsers for maximum speed.

            Tests come in three flavors! You can test user interactions, individual
            functions, and everything in between using built-in helpers.

           By default, Ember uses QUnit, and has full official support
           for Mocha. You can use your own testing tools if you'd like.
