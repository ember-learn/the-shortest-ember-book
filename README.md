# the-shortest-ember-book

This repository contains both printable materials
and a web app version of the Shortest Ember Book.
The goal is to quickly and concisely
communicate what Ember is, how it works, and steps to get started.

## Printing

Anyone is welcome to print the book(s)! Meetup organizers, speakers, and conference table hosts are especially encouraged to print and distribute copies. You can download printable assets [here](https://github.com/ember-learn/the-shortest-ember-book/tree/master/printable-materials). Follow these [folding instructions](https://github.com/ember-learn/the-shortest-ember-book/issues/7) to assemble.

## Modifications

If you want to make modifications to the book,
please open an issue/pull request, which needs to be merged before printing and distributing the modified version. 

The Tomster has [some restrictions](https://www.emberjs.com/tomster/faq/) on use outside of formal Ember.js projects. All other graphic assets were created by Braden Lawrence, and are intended for use only in the mini books.
